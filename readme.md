# one-time-event

Simple `EventSource`-like object which removes all handlers after it is fired.

## Usage

See [`demo.js`](https://github.com/c7hm4r/one-time-event/blob/master/demo.js).

Please avoid the following (in general):

    const e = newOneTimeEvent();
    e.pub.addHandler(e.fire);
    e.fire();

## Contribute

If you want to build the project or run the test, please replace `npm-shrinkwrap.json` by `npm-shrinkwrap.dev.json`. Then run `npm i` again.
It is a work around for the multiple problems npm currently has with its npm-shrinkwrap.json files and dev dependencies (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6298).

Build command: `npm run build`

Test command: `npm run test`
